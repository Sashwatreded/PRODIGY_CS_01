# 🔐 Text Encryption & Decryption using Caesar Cipher (Python GUI)

This project is a **text encryption and decryption tool** built with Python using the classic **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.  
Developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**, it features a simple and interactive **Tkinter-based GUI**.

The tool allows users to input text, select a key (shift value), and perform encryption or decryption instantly.

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt and decrypt any plain text using Caesar Cipher
- GUI built with `Tkinter`
- Input field for custom messages
- Shift key (integer-based) control
- Real-time display of results
- User-friendly and beginner-friendly design

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Example:  
Plain Text: `HELLO`  
Key (Shift): `3`  
Encrypted Text: `KHOOR`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- `tkinter` for GUI
- Basic string manipulation and ASCII operations

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Input your text** into the input box.
2. **Enter a shift key** (any integer value).
3. Click **"Encrypt"** to encrypt the message.
4. Click **"Decrypt"** to decode an encrypted message.
5. Result is shown instantly in the output area.
